This project is a simple QR Code component built using HTML and CSS. It displays a QR code inside a card with a title and description underneath. The project helped me practice creating clean, centered layouts with Flexbox and applying basic styling to build a visually appealing component.

## My process
I started by structuring the HTML with semantic elements, creating a main container for the QR code card, the image, and the text. Then I used CSS to style the card, centering it on the page with Flexbox, adding padding, borders, and text styles to make it visually appealing. The project was straightforward, focusing on practicing layout, spacing, and basic styling with HTML and CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
